# ForcaMM :joystick: :video_game:

## Project Description

Hangman game in c.

## Remarks about the program

Some warnings may occur if the compiler detects some unwritten or unread data in the buffer. If warning occurs, the problem should be resolved using fflush(stdin) or __fpurge(stdin).

## Applications

This project can be used to have fun with the game, or to learn a little about some c language concepts. Although this program is part of my personal portfolio, feel free to use it in studies, repairs and improvements. :call_me_hand:

## Motivation

This project was developed while I was in graduation and learning c, in its construction I tried to insert some concepts used in the language such as files, strings, among others. Therefore, this project is intended for learning and for future applications. :relaxed:

## Instructions for compiling and executing the code

### Initial requirements

To compile the code it is necessary to have any compiler that runs programs in c (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C_compilerss), besides this list there are online compilers that easily implement the code such as https://www.onlinegdb.com/ and https://replit.com.

**PS**: For the code to run, the FORCA.txt file must be in the same folder as the ForcaGame.c code.

### Compiling and running the code

To compile the code in serial using the GNU compiler do:

```bash
gcc ForcaGame.c
```

and run:

```bash
./a.out
```
